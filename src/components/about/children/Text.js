            Hi, my name is <strong>Nechirvan</strong>,
             I am a UX/UI designer and front-end web developer. 
            I like to call me dev <strong>Nechir /nɪtʃi:r/</strong>, 
            the word dev is for developer. 
            <br /><br />
            Since I started college (Computer Science) in 2011, programming was my interesting 
            subject, I remember the first time when I printed out “Hello World” in CPP, 
            it was hard for me until I discovered and understood the whole idea but it was 
            quite interesting. I graduated and got my CS degree in summer of 2015.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because there was a low market for software engineering, Website development, and
            coding in general here in Kurdistan region I did not get any offer of taking the 
            role of full-stack web development, or any kind of relative jobs, so in <strong>January 
            2016</strong>, I started my first job as a computer labs instructor (the role was to assist
            students to apply their work successfully in labs) in Duhok Private Technical 
            Institute DPTI, but that was not the only role I had I also was the IT officer of
            the Institute. 
            <br /> <br />
            In <strong>October 2017</strong> I moved to the University of Duhok (UoD) and had the
            same role (Computer Labs Instructor) as in institute.
            As I work in university I was looking to an opportunity of continuing my journey as
            a web developer and designer rather than being a teacher or instructor in 
            university’s labs. At that time few of my friends and colleagues were working in the 
            web development field and almost none of them were working in the way that a web 
            developer should work in.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the late of <strong>August 2019</strong>, I got <strong>my first web development job</strong>
            at (Board of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs) BRHA. It was a government organization that was 
            responsible 
            for IDPs and refugees in the Duhok governorate. BRHA was the main partnership of UNHCR
            and GIZ. BRHA website was built with WordPress by a local company, at first they asked to 
            update the website theme but later on, they asked me to rebuild and change the whole 
            website. I designed and developed the website focusing on UX/UI design principles and 
            development, you can find the website <a href="https://www.brha-duhok.org/">here</a>. I did design the website for desktop 
            layout only, due to the end of the organization's lifetime in March 2020.
